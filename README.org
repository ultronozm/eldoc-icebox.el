#+title: eldoc-icebox: Pop-up buffer with frozen copy of eldoc
#+author: Paul Nelson

* Overview
We quote the commentary from the Emacs [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ElDoc][ElDoc]] package:

#+begin_example
This program was inspired by the behavior of the "mouse documentation
window" on many Lisp Machine systems; as you type a function's symbol
name as part of a sexp, it will print the argument list for that
function.  Behavior is not identical; for example, you need not actually
type the function name, you need only move point around in a sexp that
calls it.  Also, if point is over a documented variable, it will print
the one-line documentation for that variable instead, to remind you of
that variable's meaning.
#+end_example

One can also display the documentation in a separate buffer, or in a childframe -- see for instance [[https://github.com/casouri/eldoc-box][eldoc-box]].

The present package addresses the following situation: you want to stare at a copy of the docs for one position while editing at another position.  To achieve this, it introduces commands that allow you to store a frozen copy of the content of the *eldoc* buffer in a pop-up window:
- =eldoc-icebox-store= :: stores the copy, displays the window.
- =eldoc-icebox-toggle-display= :: toggles the display.

Here's a quick demonstration of =eldoc-icebox-store=:

* Configuration
Download this repository, install using =M-x package-install-file= (or package-vc-install, straight, elpaca, ...), and add something like the following to your [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/InitFile][init file]]:
#+begin_src elisp
(use-package eldoc-icebox
  :bind (("C-c C-h" . eldoc-icebox-store)
         ("C-c C-n" . eldoc-icebox-toggle-display))
  :hook
  (eldoc-icebox-post-display . shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer))
#+end_src

Customize the binds as you like, and use the built-in documentation (=C-h f czm-eldoc-icebox-whatever=) to see exactly what the commands do.

You can adjust the customization variable =eldoc-icebox-display-action= to change how the pop-up is displayed (see the [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Displaying-Buffers.html][display-buffer documentation]]).

The =:hook= line is optional.  If you delete it, then the icebox will not shrink to the size of the documentation.

It may be convenient to add other mode-specific hooks (see the bottom of https://github.com/ultronozm/czm-lean4.el for what I use); in writing these, it may be useful to know that the icebox buffer is initialized with a local variable =eldoc-icebox-parent-buffer= pointing to the buffer from which it was created.
